<p>The Gund Gallery Collection is dedicated to 20th and 21st century art.  This focus was chosen to expose students and our community to the rich array of material, conceptual techniques and methodologies deployed by artists of the 20th and 21st centuries.  The collection fosters opportunities to contribute to Kenyon Collegeâ€™s liberal arts curricula and the community through exhibitions and collections-dependent programs. </p>
<p>The Gund Gallery Collection is made up of works collected by the college over its history and was seeded by a recent gift of 80 works of important contemporary art generously donated by Mr. and Mrs. Graham and Ann Gund. Graham Gund, a noted architect, collector and philanthropist, is a 1963 graduate of Kenyon. The substantial donation includes work by Bernd &amp; Hilla Becher, Ingrid Calame, Dale Chihuly, Christo and Jeanne-Claude, Antony Gormley, Philip Guston, Roy Lichtenstein, Paul Manship, Laura McPhee, Henry Moore, Kenneth Noland, Claes Oldenberg, Pablo Picasso, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, Joel Sternfeld, and other eminent artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. </p>
