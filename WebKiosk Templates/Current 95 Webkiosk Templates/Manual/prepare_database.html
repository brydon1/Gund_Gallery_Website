To appear in the kiosk, records must be flagged for web access and images must be in a format accepted by web browsers.  In addition, the more thorough and consistent your data is, the more useful your kiosk will be.

<br><br>

This section explains how to accomplish these tasks within EmbARK before setting up the kiosk, with chapter references to the EmbARK documentation.

	You will create (and update) the data in your EmbARK Web Kiosk by copying the latest version of your entire EmbARK datafile to the web server.  Because you may not want all of your records to be available for public viewing, strict controls limit which records display in the kiosk.

	<br><br>

		<li>In the &quot;<b>Choose the search domain</b>&quot; box, select the radio button for <b>Current Selection of Records</b>.<br>
			If you want to mark the entire database for web access, choose &quot;<b>All Records in Table</b>&quot;.
		<li>Click the <b>Replace</b> button.<br>
			EmbARK will mark every selected object for web access.  It will automatically ask if you wish to make the same change for the Image Web Access field (if the status is changed).
		<li>Repeat as appropriate Artist, Surrogate, and Portfolio records.
		</ol>

<h2>Preparing Media Files</h2>

<table cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td>

	The kiosk can display surrogate images linked to Object and Artist records.  These images, however, will only display if their file format is readable by web browsers and their names and location conform to internet standards.

	<a name="file_format"></a>
	<h3>What File Format Should I Use?</h3>

	<table cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td>

		Images in the JPEG format (with a file extension of .jpg) are the easiest for web browsers to display. In addition, your kiosk images will be displayed to visitors more quickly if you compress them to a smaller file size. Web Kiosk can also publish sound and movie files (such as .MP3 and .MP4).

		<br><br>

		Thumbnails and previews will display in the kiosk, regardless of the file format of the original source image.

	<h3>Converting Image Filenames</h3>

	<table cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td>

		If your images are already in a format that web browsers can display but the names of the files are not web-compatible (for example, they contain spaces, or are Macintosh files without extensions), use the EmbARK cataloguing application to follow the steps below.  
		<ol>
		<li>Search for the image files whose names you want to change.<br>
			For example, to find all images that contain spaces, go to Full Search in the Selection menu.  Search for (1) SURROGATE records where (2) the Surrogate: Web Access field is equal to "yes".
		<li>When the search results are displayed, click the <b>View Related</b> button to load the associated Media records and their metadata.
		<li>Select all of the Media records that require a change (e.g. illegal characters, no file extension, etc.).<br>
			<b>Note:</b> If the image files are in incompatible formats (such as TIFF or BMP), you will have to use an application such as Photoshop to create compatible formats.
		<li>Click the button that says <b>Thumbnails</b> to load a thumbnail view.
		<li>Click the <b>Rename</b> button in the left button bar.<br>
			The Rename dialog box appears, with the original image filenames on the left and a separate list for entering new names on the right.  (Images can only be renamed if they are online.  To quickly select online images before doing the Rename, click the Select... button and choose ONLINE.  Online records will be highlighted with a red outline.)
		<li>Click the <b>Web Style</b> button.<br>
			A configuration dialog opens.
		<li>Enter the appropriate file extension (for example, &quot;<b>.jpg</b>&quot; for JPEG files).
		<li>The <b>Illegal Characters</b> list specifies which characters will get replaced with the replacement character (typically an underscore). Modify this as needed.
		<li>Click <b>Done</b> to close the dialog.<br>
			The filenames listed on the right will be converted to web-compatible names (with file extensions, and illegal characters replaced; for example, "My Image" might become "My_Image.jpg"), and the corresponding image files will be renamed.
		<li>Repeat this process for any additional groups of images.
		</ol>

		<h4>Notes</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>On some Macintosh systems, image filenames may not be longer than 27 characters.  If there are more than 27 characters, EmbARK may not be able to correct the image filename and still provide a unique filename.  If this occurs, an error log will appear listing the filenames that could not be changed.

	<h3>Image Location</h3>

	<table cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td>

		Follow these guidelines for organizing images to be included in the EmbARK Web Kiosk.

		<br><br>

		<ul>
		<li>All your images must be stored within a single folder called <b>Images</b>.
		<li><b>The Images folder name must appear in the file paths that are stored in EmbARK.</b> On networked Windows machines, this means that a folder <i>above</i> the Images folder must be mapped to a local drive. This ensures that the image path  is stored as I:\Images\myPicture.gif (for example). If the Images folder itself is mapped to a drive letter, the image path in EmbARK will read I:\myPicture.gif, and images will not load correctly in the kiosk.
		<li>You can create as many subfolders as you wish inside the Images folder, but do not include the word &quot;Images&quot; in the name of any of these subfolders.  
		<li>The folder or subfolder names must not contain any spaces or other characters that web browsers cannot interpret (for example, use My_Folder instead of My Folder).
		<li>It is possible to configure the Images directory so that it may be shared by both EmbARK and EmbARK Web Kiosk.  The Images folder must be within the EmbARK Web Kiosk directory or on some other web server space.  This configuration eliminates the need to have two copies of your source images.  IIS may be used to create a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/172138" target=_blank>virtual directory.</a> The <a href="customizing.html#images_url">Media Directory URL</a> can be set to point to the virtual directory.</ul>

<h2>Cataloguing Data</h2>

<table cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td>

	The kiosk lets visitors search your collection based on &quot;Advanced Search&quot; fields from the Object and Artist records, the Object Creation Date, Keywords, and additional Object fields with the &quot;Quick Search&quot;.

	<br><br>

	For the Advanced Search and keyword searches to work effectively, you must catalog the objects in the collection as thoroughly and consistently as possible. This helps to ensure that potential search results are not &quot;missed&quot; because the data entry for an object was incomplete or did not match entries for similar objects.

	<a name="advanced_search_fields"></a>
	<h3>Advanced Search Fields</h3>

	<table cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td>

		On the <b>Advanced Search</b> page, visitors are presented with popups for selecting a field to search. Once they select a field, they are presented with a popup of every value entered in that field for web accessible records. If the selected field contains a large number of unique values, the visitor must first select a beginning letter, then choose from values that begin with that letter.

		<br><br>

		Because the user is presented with value lists, the Advanced Search is most useful for fields where the same value has been used for many records. This both ensures a succinct value list and gives the visitor more satisfying search results.

		<br><br>

		Consistent data entry is critical for creating an effective Advanced Search. The best way to guarantee consistent data entry in these fields is to set up <b>Choice Lists</b> for them early in the data entry process. [See Chapter 2 of the EmbARK User’s Guide.]

		<br><br>

		One of the early steps for setting up an EmbARK Web Kiosk is to determine which fields should be used as &quot;Advanced Search Fields&quot;. The <a href="customizing.html#ObjAdvanced_Search_Fields">Object Advanced Search</a> section details how to configure these fields.

		<br><br>

		Once the Advanced Search fields have been selected, it's worthwhile to take a few minutes to review the data that has been entered in these fields, and clean it up if necessary.

		<br><br>

		In EmbARK, you can use the <b>Unique Values</b> report to make sure that the data entered in your Advanced Search fields is consistent, and the Replace feature to standardize the data in any fields where you find inconsistent data.  To do this, follow these steps:

		<ol>
		<li>In EmbARK, choose <b>Tools</b> from the <b>Utilities</b> menu (start at the splash screen view).<br>
			The Tools dialog box appears.
		<li>Select the <b>Unique Values Report</b> option, then click <b>OK</b>.<br>
			A field selection dialog box appears.
		<li>Choose the table and the field whose data you want to review, then click <b>OK</b>.<br>
			A report showing all of the values entered in the field you chose is printed automatically.  In the report, spaces in any value will be replaced by the text &quot;<b>[SPACE]</b>&quot; so that you can easily identify incorrect or inconsistent spacing.<br>
			<img src="images/unique_values.gif" width="235" height="205" border="1" vspace="6" alt="Unique Values Report Sample"><br>
		<li>Review the displayed values and note any inconsistencies.<br>
			For example, if the Century field contains both &quot;17th Century&quot; and &quot;17th Cent.&quot; as values, this is an inconsistency that should be fixed.
		<li>Choose <b>Replace</b> from the <b>Utilities</b> menu.<br>
			The Replace dialog box appears.
		<li>In lines 1 and 3, choose a table and field with inconsistent data.<br>
			For example, to fix the inconsistency mentioned in step 4, you would choose <b>Object</b> in line 1 and <b>Century</b> in line 3.
		<li>In line 4, type the inconsistent text that you want to change (for example, &quot;<b>17th Cent.</b>&quot;).
		<li>In line 5, type the text that you want to use as the consistent text for this value (for example, &quot;<b>17th Century</b>&quot;).
		<li>Click <b>Replace</b>.<br>
			EmbARK will change all values matching the text in line 4 to match the text in line 5. (For example, &quot;17th Cent.&quot; will be changed to &quot;17th Century&quot;.)
		</ol>

		<h4>Notes</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>The best Advanced Search fields are those where the same value applies to several records (for example, Medium or Object Type) rather than fields where the information for each record is likely to be unique (for example, Display Title or Accession Number).
		<li>If you do need to let kiosk visitors search for objects by using a field with many unique values (such as Display Title), you can help them by designating the field for use in the Quick Search, which looks for partial information (for example, any object with &quot;Mask&quot; in the title).  [See <a href="prepare_database.html#quick_search">Choosing Fields for the Quick Search</a> for details.]
		</ul>

	</td></tr></table>

	<a name="keywords"></a>
	<h3>Keywords</h3>

	<table cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td>

		Kiosk visitors can also search your collection by keyword.

		<br><br>

		Through the kiosk they can run searches to find keyword terms that have been used on web accessible Objects in EmbARK. This includes each component of hierarchical keywords such as <b>animals:dogs:hounds:basset</b>. They can then select up to 6 of these words to find related Objects.

		<br><br>

		[See Chapters 12 and 14 of the EmbARK User's Guide for details about cataloguing with keywords.]

		<br><br>

		The more thoroughly you have used keywords to describe your collection, the more useful these searches will be.  In fact, because some kiosk users may prefer keyword searches to field-based searches, you may wish to enter the values used in one or more of your Quick Search fields (for example, Medium) as keywords.  Similarly, you might enter values from fields that are not included in the Quick Search list as keywords, in order to offer users an indirect way to search your kiosk based on the information in those fields.

Surrogates allow for the display of detailed information about the image using fields from the Surrogate record.  From the Object &quot;Description&quot; web page, the kiosk visitor can click into a page of all the web accessible Surrogates linked to the object (or the surrogates can be viewed as "Additional Images" on the same page).

		EmbARK allows you to display multiple media files for an object through the use of <b>Details</b>. In fact, details are merely surrogate records that have been given a special flag (and there is little reason to use them). From the Object &quot;Description&quot; web page, the kiosk visitor can click into a page of all the details linked to the object.  
		<br><br>

		The default label for each detail is the image filename. To change the caption value, simply adjust the value in the <b>View</b> field in the Modify Surrogate record.

		<br><br>
		If the Details screen is loaded in EmbARK, you may use drag-and-drop to manually adjust the display order of the Detail images.
