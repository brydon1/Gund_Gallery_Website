<h1>Introduction</h1>

The EmbARK Web Kiosk lets you make all or part of your EmbARK collection available for viewing on a web browser, either over the Internet or through your institution’s local network.

<br><br>

Visitors to your kiosk will be able to view objects and data from your collection by selecting &quot;paths&quot; or portfolios that you have set up, or by searching for records based on keywords or specific artist/object information.

<br><br>

In each case, the kiosk merges the chosen records and images with predesigned web page templates to present the results in an attractive format.  You can customize these templates to match the appearance of your institution’s website.

<br><br>

This supplement is presented in seven sections:
<ul>
<li><b>Setup Checklist</b> provides a suggested sequence of steps for a Web Kiosk implemenation.
<li><b>Preparing the Database</b> explains how to use EmbARK to identify the records and images to be included in the EmbARK Web Kiosk, and contains cataloging tips that will make the kiosk more effective.
<li><b>Setting Up the Server</b> describes how to install the EmbARK Web Kiosk software on your web server.
<li><b>Maintaining the Kiosk</b> details tasks that should be performed occasionally to keep your EmbARK Web Kiosk running and updated properly.
<li><b>Customizing the Kiosk</b> reviews the HTML templates and commands used in the EmbARK Web Kiosk, and outlines how to customize the templates to work with your datafile and your overall website.
<li><b>Kiosk Tags</b> is a listing of each of the codes that can be used for displaying information on the kiosk pages.
<li><b>4D Tags</b> is a listing of advanced scripting tools that can be used in addition to Kiosk Tags.
<li><b>XML Data Sharing</b> provides details regarding tools for generating custom data output (such as XML or SHTML) and using advanced URL queries to return that data set.  This is an ADVANCED feature.
<li><b>Appendix</b> provides information on additional topics such as image zooming with Zoomify and running the kiosk as an automatic service.
